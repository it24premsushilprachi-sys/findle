        The primary purpose of a budget tracker website is to help users create and stick to a budget. It allows users
        to set financial goals, categorize expenses, and monitor spending patterns. By inputting income and expenses,
        the website generates visual representations, such as charts and graphs, that give users a comprehensive
        overview of their financial activities. </p>

      organizes and categorizes these expenses to provide a detailed breakdown of where money is being spent.
